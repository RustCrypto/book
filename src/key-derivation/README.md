# Key Derivation Functions

[Key derivation functions] (KDFs) provide a way to take an input such as a password, and create an
output of specified length. This output can then be used, for example, as the key for an encryption
algorithm.

Password hashing functions are a subset of key derivation functions; see
[Password Hashing](hashing-password.md) for more information on those.
